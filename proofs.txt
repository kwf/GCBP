Proof of GCBP from Garsia-Milne:

Given (m : A0 + A1 <-> B0 + B1) and (s : A1 <-> B1).  Let A+ = A0+A1,
similarly for B+.  Let A- = A1, B- = B1.  Define alpha : A+ <-> A-
which leaves A0 alone and swaps the A1 part of A+ with A-, similarly
for beta : B+ <-> B-.  Then Garsia-Milne constructs a bijection A0 <->
B0 (in fact, the same one that GCBP constructs).
