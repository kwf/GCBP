Proof of GCBP from Garsia-Milne:

Given (m : A0 + A1 <-> B0 + B1) and (s : A1 <-> B1).  Let A+ = A0+A1,
similarly for B+.  Let A- = A1, B- = B1.  Define alpha : A+ <-> A-
which leaves A0 alone and swaps the A1 part of A+ with A-, similarly
for beta : B+ <-> B-.  Then Garsia-Milne constructs a bijection A0 <->
B0 (in fact, the same one that GCBP constructs).

Proof of G-M from GCBP:

Set A0 = F_alpha etc.  Set A1 = A - F_alpha.  f is a bijection between
A0 + A1.  For the bijection between A1 <-> B1, do what f does on A- /
B-, and then do the same thing on A+ - F_alpha / B+ - F_beta under the
correspondences induced by alpha / beta.

Does this give the same function as G-M would???
